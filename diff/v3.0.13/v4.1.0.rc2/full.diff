-== Welcome to Rails
-
-Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
-database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.
-
-This pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into "dumb"
-templates that are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between
-HTML tags. The model contains the "smart" domain objects (such as Account,
-Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to
-persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests
-(such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model
-and directing data to the view.
-
-In Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping
-layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from
-database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
-methods. You can read more about Active Record in
-link:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.
-
-The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
-layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers
-are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is
-unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much
-more separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of
-Rails. You can read more about Action Pack in
-link:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.
-
-
-== Getting Started
-
-1. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:
-       <tt>rails new myapp</tt> (where <tt>myapp</tt> is the application name)
-
-2. Change directory to <tt>myapp</tt> and start the web server:
-       <tt>cd myapp; rails server</tt> (run with --help for options)
-
-3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see:
-       "Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!"
-
-4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You can find
-the following resources handy:
-
-* The Getting Started Guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
-* Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book: http://www.railstutorial.org/
-
-
-== Debugging Rails
-
-Sometimes your application goes wrong. Fortunately there are a lot of tools that
-will help you debug it and get it back on the rails.
-
-First area to check is the application log files. Have "tail -f" commands
-running on the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display
-debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be
-shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.
-
-You can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code
-using the Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:
-
-  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
-    def destroy
-      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])
-      @weblog.destroy
-      logger.info("#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!")
-    end
-  end
-
-The result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:
-
-  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1!
-
-More information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/
-
-Also, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/. There are
-several books available online as well:
-
-* Programming Ruby: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/ (Pickaxe)
-* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/ (a beginners guide)
-
-These two books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language and also on
-programming in general.
-
-
-== Debugger
-
-Debugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your
-Mongrel or WEBrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of
-execution at any point in the code, investigate and change the model, and then,
-resume execution! You need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging
-mode. With gems, use <tt>sudo gem install ruby-debug</tt>. Example:
-
-  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
-    def index
-      @posts = Post.find(:all)
-      debugger
-    end
-  end
-
-So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you
-with a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:
-
-  >> @posts.inspect
-  => "[#<Post:0x14a6be8
-          @attributes={"title"=>nil, "body"=>nil, "id"=>"1"}>,
-       #<Post:0x14a6620
-          @attributes={"title"=>"Rails", "body"=>"Only ten..", "id"=>"2"}>]"
-  >> @posts.first.title = "hello from a debugger"
-  => "hello from a debugger"
-
-...and even better, you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:
-
-  >> f = @posts.first
-  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={"title"=>nil, "body"=>nil, "id"=>"1"}>
-  >> f.
-  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
-
-Finally, when you're ready to resume execution, you can enter "cont".
-
-
-== Console
-
-The console is a Ruby shell, which allows you to interact with your
-application's domain model. Here you'll have all parts of the application
-configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can inspect
-domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting the script
-without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
-
-To start the console, run <tt>rails console</tt> from the application
-directory.
-
-Options:
-
-* Passing the <tt>-s, --sandbox</tt> argument will rollback any modifications
-  made to the database.
-* Passing an environment name as an argument will load the corresponding
-  environment. Example: <tt>rails console production</tt>.
-
-To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
-<tt>reload!</tt>
-
-More information about irb can be found at:
-link:http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/irb.html
-
-
-== dbconsole
-
-You can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>rails
-dbconsole</tt>. You would be connected to the database with the credentials
-defined in database.yml. Starting the script without arguments will connect you
-to the development database. Passing an argument will connect you to a different
-database, like <tt>rails dbconsole production</tt>. Currently works for MySQL,
-PostgreSQL and SQLite 3.

-app
-  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
-
-app/controllers
-  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
-  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
-  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.
-
-app/models
-  Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from
-  ActiveRecord::Base by default.
-
-app/views
-  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
-  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use
-  eRuby syntax by default.
-
-app/views/layouts
-  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
-  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
-  using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.
-  Inside default.html.erb, call <% yield %> to render the view using this
-  layout.
-
-app/helpers
-  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are
-  generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.
-  Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.
-
-config
-  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,
-  and other dependencies.
-
-db
-  Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the
-  sequence of Migrations for your schema.
-
-doc
-  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when
-  generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>
-
-lib
-  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
-  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in
-  the load path.
-
-public
-  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for
-  images, stylesheets, and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the
-  default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web
-  server.
-
-script
-  Helper scripts for automation and generation.
-
-test
-  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
-  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
-  directory.
-
-vendor
-  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins
-  subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under
-  vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.

-// Autocompleter.Base handles all the autocompletion functionality
-// that's independent of the data source for autocompletion. This
-// includes drawing the autocompletion menu, observing keyboard
-// and mouse events, and similar.
-//
-// Specific autocompleters need to provide, at the very least,
-// a getUpdatedChoices function that will be invoked every time
-// the text inside the monitored textbox changes. This method
-// should get the text for which to provide autocompletion by
-// invoking this.getToken(), NOT by directly accessing
-// this.element.value. This is to allow incremental tokenized
-// autocompletion. Specific auto-completion logic (AJAX, etc)
-// belongs in getUpdatedChoices.
-//
-// Tokenized incremental autocompletion is enabled automatically
-// when an autocompleter is instantiated with the 'tokens' option
-// in the options parameter, e.g.:
-// new Ajax.Autocompleter('id','upd', '/url/', { tokens: ',' });
-// will incrementally autocomplete with a comma as the token.
-// Additionally, ',' in the above example can be replaced with
-// a token array, e.g. { tokens: [',', '\n'] } which
-// enables autocompletion on multiple tokens. This is most
-// useful when one of the tokens is \n (a newline), as it
-// allows smart autocompletion after linebreaks.

-// The local array autocompleter. Used when you'd prefer to
-// inject an array of autocompletion options into the page, rather
-// than sending out Ajax queries, which can be quite slow sometimes.
-//
-// The constructor takes four parameters. The first two are, as usual,
-// the id of the monitored textbox, and id of the autocompletion menu.
-// The third is the array you want to autocomplete from, and the fourth
-// is the options block.
-//
-// Extra local autocompletion options:
-// - choices - How many autocompletion choices to offer
-//
-// - partialSearch - If false, the autocompleter will match entered
-//                    text only at the beginning of strings in the
-//                    autocomplete array. Defaults to true, which will
-//                    match text at the beginning of any *word* in the
-//                    strings in the autocomplete array. If you want to
-//                    search anywhere in the string, additionally set
-//                    the option fullSearch to true (default: off).
-//
-// - fullSsearch - Search anywhere in autocomplete array strings.
-//
-// - partialChars - How many characters to enter before triggering
-//                   a partial match (unlike minChars, which defines
-//                   how many characters are required to do any match
-//                   at all). Defaults to 2.
-//
-// - ignoreCase - Whether to ignore case when autocompleting.
-//                 Defaults to true.
-//
-// It's possible to pass in a custom function as the 'selector'
-// option, if you prefer to write your own autocompletion logic.
-// In that case, the other options above will not apply unless
-// you support them.
